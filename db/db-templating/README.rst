db-templating
=============

We generate many postgresql files from jinja2 templates.

To generate the files, you have to run the ``apply-templates.py`` script
located in ``mox/oio_rest/``.

``templates/`` contains the jinja2 templates.
``generated-files/`` contains an up-to-date version of the output.
