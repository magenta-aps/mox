How to generate these patches:

Run recreatedb.sh and note which patch files have failed:
./recreatedb.sh &> recreatedb.log
grep -i fail recreatedb.log

Edit recreatedb.sh and comment out the lines beginning with "patch" which apply the patch files that have failed

Use a diff utility, for example, meld to view the differences between the
../patches/*.org.sql file and the  ../generated-files/*.sql file

For example:

  meld as_create_or_import_dokument.org.sql ../generated-files/as_create_or_import_dokument.sql

Resolve the conflicts using the diff utility, such that the .org.sql file is updated
with the given changes from the generated .sql file.

Generate a new patch file, for example:

  diff --context=5 ../generated-files/as_create_or_import_dokument.sql ../patches/as_create_or_import_dokument.org.sql > ../patches/as_create_or_import_dokument.sql.diff

Uncomment the patch lines in recreatedb.sh
Run recreatedb.sh again
