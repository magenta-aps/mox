Version 0.9.0-post1, 1 June 2018
--------------------------------

This hotfix contains no code changes, but updates the version metadata
for the ``oio_rest`` package.

Version 0.9.0, 7 May 2018
-------------------------

This is a major version, including non-backwards-compatible changes to
the REST protocol, parameter checks, JSON input validation, unit tests
and integration tests.

Backwards incompatible changes:

* Allow replacing an object with PUT - updates now use PATCH (non-
  compatible with previous versions).
* Return an explicit error (410 Gone) on attempts to access a deleted
  object.
* Validate query parameters given during search, return an error when
  given unrecognised or unsupported arguments.
* JSON Schema validation when creating new objects.

New features:

* Comprehensive test suite, including:

  * Unit tests of our REST API.
  * Integration tests based on the standards.
  * End-to-end integration tests of the REST API and database layer.
  * Continuous integration infrastructure that runs our test suite on
    each push to GitHub.

* Allow requesting objects at a certain registration or validity
  time. Previously, we either allowed searching within an interval or
  the current time.
* Migration to Python 3; minimum version required is now Python 3.5
  rather than 2.7.
* New and improved installer based on SaltStack to enable provisioning
  of client installations.

Bug fixes:

* An update with an empty list of relations deleted all
  relations.
* Fixed semantics for DELETE, so that we no longer merge old entries
  when reviving an object.
