Building documentation
======================

This README file is part of our documentation, and an HTML version can
be obtained by the following command in a command prompt::

    $ make -C doc

Note that this requires Sphinx to be installed â€” on Ubuntu or
Debian, this can be done with the following command::

    $ sudo apt install python-sphinx
